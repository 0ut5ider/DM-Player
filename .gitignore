# Application Data & Uploads
# The 'projects/' directory is intended to store all user-generated data,
# including the main 'projects.json' list, individual project data JSON files
# ('<project_id>/project_data.json'), and all uploaded MP3 files
# ('<project_id>/audio/*.mp3'). This data is dynamic and specific to an
# instance of the application, so it should not be version controlled.

# Editor/IDE specific files
# VSCode specific files. Often, project-specific settings like
# .vscode/settings.json or .vscode/launch.json are committed if they
# are beneficial for all collaborators. User-specific workspace settings
# should be ignored. You can uncomment and adjust this as needed.
