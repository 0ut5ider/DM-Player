- **Error Logging**: Limited error logging and monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: No performance metrics collection
- **Documentation**: Limited user documentation and help system

### Scalability Considerations üìà
- **Concurrent Users**: SQLite may have limitations with many simultaneous users
- **File Storage**: Large numbers of audio files may impact performance
- **Database Size**: Large datasets may require query optimization
- **Memory Usage**: Long-running sessions may accumulate memory usage

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution
- **v1.0.1-1.0.4**: Single-user JSON-based storage
- **v1.0.5-1.0.9**: Enhanced UI and SQLite migration
- **v1.0.10-1.0.11**: Multi-user authentication and gallery system

### Key Decision Points
1. **JSON to SQLite**: Improved data integrity and query capabilities
2. **Session-based Auth**: Chosen over JWT for simplicity and security
3. **Global Player**: Enhanced UX by making player persistent across views
4. **Public Gallery**: Significantly improved user engagement and discovery

### Lessons Learned
- **Iterative Development**: Small, incremental changes were more successful than large rewrites
- **User-Centric Design**: Focusing on user workflows led to better architecture decisions
- **Security First**: Implementing security early prevented major refactoring later
- **Documentation Value**: Good documentation significantly aids development velocity

The DM Player project has successfully achieved its goals and is ready for real-world usage, feedback, and potential scaling based on user adoption.
