# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank Initialization
**Status**: In Progress  
**Task**: Creating comprehensive memory bank documentation for DM-Player project

The memory bank is being established to provide complete context for future development sessions. This includes documenting the existing codebase, architecture patterns, and project goals.

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation (Current Session)
- **Created**: `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document defining project scope and requirements
- **Created**: `productContext.md` - User experience goals and problem definition
- **Created**: `systemPatterns.md` - Technical architecture and design patterns
- **Created**: `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development environment
- **In Progress**: `activeContext.md` - Current work status and next steps
- **Pending**: `progress.md` - Implementation status and known issues

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**
   - Finish `activeContext.md` (this file)
   - Create `progress.md` with current implementation status
   - Review all files for completeness and accuracy

2. **Analyze Current Implementation**
   - Review frontend JavaScript (`public/app.js`) for functionality gaps
   - Check CSS styling for UI/UX improvements needed
   - Verify all API endpoints are properly implemented

3. **Identify Development Priorities**
   - Document any missing features from the original requirements
   - Note any bugs or issues in current implementation
   - Plan improvements and enhancements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Database Migration**: Project has migrated from JSON file storage to SQLite database
- **UUID Strategy**: All entities use UUID v4 for unique identification
- **File Organization**: MP3 files stored in project-specific directories with UUID filenames
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling patterns

### Current Technical Patterns
- **Frontend**: Single-page application with vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Backend**: Express.js with middleware-based request handling
- **Data Flow**: Frontend → API → Database/FileSystem → Response
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error format across all endpoints

### User Experience Patterns
- **Modal-Based Interactions**: All user input through modal dialogs
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate UI updates after successful operations
- **Visual Timeline**: Cue points displayed on interactive timeline
- **Responsive Design**: Interface adapts to different screen sizes

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Preferences
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between frontend, backend, and data layers
- **Consistent Naming**: camelCase for JavaScript, kebab-case for CSS classes
- **Error First**: All async operations handle errors before success cases
- **Resource Return**: API operations return the affected resource for immediate UI updates

### Development Patterns
- **Database First**: All data operations go through SQLite with proper foreign key constraints
- **File System Coordination**: File operations coordinated with database operations
- **Atomic Operations**: Multi-step operations designed to be atomic where possible
- **Validation Layers**: Input validation at both frontend and backend levels

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex functionality revealed as needed
- **Immediate Feedback**: All user actions provide immediate visual feedback
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Form inputs support standard keyboard navigation

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- **SQLite Integration**: Successfully migrated from JSON to SQLite for better data integrity
- **Audio Metadata**: music-metadata library provides reliable duration extraction
- **File Upload Handling**: Multer with custom storage configuration works well for MP3 files
- **Frontend State Management**: Vanilla JavaScript sufficient for current complexity level

### User Experience Insights
- **Cue Point Visualization**: Timeline representation crucial for understanding track switching
- **Project Organization**: Users need clear project separation for different sessions/campaigns
- **Audio Control**: Standard playback controls with visual progress indication essential
- **File Management**: Simple upload/delete operations preferred over complex file management

### Performance Insights
- **Database Performance**: SQLite performs well for expected data volumes
- **Audio Streaming**: Browser handles MP3 streaming efficiently
- **File Storage**: Local file system adequate for single-user application
- **Memory Usage**: Current implementation has reasonable memory footprint

## Current Challenges

### Known Technical Challenges
- **Audio Transition Smoothness**: Ensuring seamless track switching at cue points
- **Cue Point Precision**: Maintaining accurate timing for cue point triggers
- **File Upload Feedback**: Providing clear progress indication during uploads
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network and file system errors

### User Experience Challenges
- **Cue Point Management**: Making cue point editing intuitive and precise
- **Track Organization**: Helping users organize large numbers of tracks
- **Session Management**: Maintaining state during long playback sessions
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of system state and user actions

## Development Environment Notes

### Current Setup
- **Server Port**: Running on port 3001 (configurable)
- **Database**: SQLite file in project root (`dm_player.sqlite`)
- **File Storage**: `projects/` directory with project-specific subdirectories
- **Frontend**: Served statically from `public/` directory

### Development Workflow
- **Hot Reload**: Manual server restart required for backend changes
- **Frontend Changes**: Immediate (served statically)
- **Database Changes**: Automatic schema creation on startup
- **File Operations**: Real-time through API endpoints

## Context for Future Sessions

### Key Files to Review
- **`server.js`**: Main application logic and API endpoints
- **`database.js`**: Database schema and connection management
- **`public/app.js`**: Frontend application logic and UI management
- **`public/style.css`**: Application styling and responsive design
- **`public/index.html`**: Application structure and modal definitions

### Important Concepts
- **Project-Centric Design**: Everything organized around projects containing tracks and cue points
- **Cue-Driven Playback**: Core feature is automatic track switching at specified time points
- **Random Selection**: Track switching uses randomization excluding current track
- **Visual Timeline**: Cue points and progress visualized on interactive timeline

### Success Metrics
- **Functional Completeness**: All core features working as specified
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning
- **Performance**: Smooth audio playback and responsive UI
- **Reliability**: Consistent behavior across different usage scenarios
