# DM Player - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The DM Player application is currently in a **fully functional state** with all core features implemented and working. The project has evolved from a simple single-user music player to a comprehensive multi-user platform with authentication, project ownership, and a public gallery system.

## Recent Changes & Current State

### Latest Version: 1.0.11
The application has undergone significant evolution through 11 major versions:

**Authentication & Multi-User System (v1.0.10-1.0.11)**
- Implemented complete user authentication system with registration, login, logout
- Added user sessions with SQLite-backed session storage
- Created project ownership model with proper authorization middleware
- Built public gallery for project discovery and playback
- Added multi-view navigation system (login, register, gallery, my-projects, project-detail)

**Advanced Player Features (v1.0.5-1.0.9)**
- Implemented cue-point-aware scrubbing and seeking
- Added visual cue point timeline with draggable dots
- Enhanced player with global controls accessible across views
- Migrated from JSON file storage to SQLite database
- Added version display and improved UI organization

**Core Functionality (v1.0.1-1.0.4)**
- Fixed critical audio playback issues with cue point switching
- Implemented dynamic track switching at cue points
- Added precise timing controls and UI improvements
- Reorganized interface with side-by-side tracks/cues layout

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Maintenance
- **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any issues with SQLite database under load
- **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on the gallery and authentication experience
- **Bug Fixes**: Address any issues that arise from multi-user usage

### Potential Enhancements
- **Improved Gallery**: Add search, filtering, and sorting options for projects
- **User Profiles**: Enhanced user profile pages with bio and project showcase
- **Project Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on projects
- **Advanced Audio**: Support for additional audio formats beyond MP3
- **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience and touch interactions

### Technical Debt
- **Error Handling**: More robust error handling and user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries for larger datasets
- **Security**: Enhanced security measures for production deployment
- **Testing**: Add automated testing for critical functionality

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **SQLite Choice**: Chosen for simplicity and single-server deployment model
- **Session-based Auth**: Preferred over JWT for simplicity and security
- **File System Storage**: MP3 files stored on filesystem rather than database BLOBs
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frontend frameworks to keep complexity low

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Global Player**: Player controls persist across views for seamless experience
- **Context-aware Controls**: Edit/delete buttons only shown to project owners
- **Hash-based Routing**: Simple client-side routing without external router
- **Modal System**: Consistent modal patterns for all forms

### Data Management
- **UUID Identifiers**: Used throughout for security and uniqueness
- **Cascade Deletes**: Database handles cleanup automatically
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, syncs with server
- **Metadata Extraction**: Audio duration extracted and stored for UI

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between auth, player, and project logic
- **Event-driven Updates**: DOM updates triggered by API responses
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names

### User Experience Principles
- **Immediate Feedback**: Actions provide instant visual feedback
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear navigation paths between views
- **Ownership Clarity**: Clear indication of what users can and cannot edit
- **Seamless Playback**: Audio continues playing during view transitions

### Security Practices
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated on server side
- **Authorization Checks**: Ownership verified for all write operations
- **Secure Sessions**: HTTP-only cookies with proper configuration
- **XSS Prevention**: HTML escaping for all user-generated content

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Technical Learnings
- **Audio API Complexity**: HTML5 Audio API requires careful state management
- **Cue Point Precision**: Time-based switching needs robust timing logic
- **File Upload Challenges**: Multer configuration and error handling is critical
- **SQLite Limitations**: Good for single-server, but not for distributed systems

### User Experience Insights
- **Gallery Discovery**: Public gallery significantly enhances user engagement
- **Ownership Model**: Clear ownership boundaries improve user confidence
- **Global Player**: Persistent player controls improve usability across views
- **Visual Cue Timeline**: Visual representation of cue points aids understanding

### Development Process
- **Iterative Approach**: Small, incremental changes worked well
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on user workflows over technical complexity
- **Documentation Importance**: Clear documentation aids future development
- **Testing Strategy**: Manual testing sufficient for MVP, automation needed for scale

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Concurrent Access**: SQLite may have limitations with many simultaneous users
- **File Management**: Large numbers of audio files may impact performance
- **Browser Compatibility**: Some audio features may not work in older browsers
- **Memory Usage**: Large projects with many tracks may impact performance

### User Experience Challenges
- **Discovery**: Gallery may become unwieldy with many projects
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch interactions could be improved
- **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more user-friendly
- **Loading States**: Better loading indicators needed for slow operations

### Business Challenges
- **Scalability**: Current architecture suitable for moderate usage only
- **Storage Costs**: Audio file storage could become expensive at scale
- **Content Moderation**: No system for moderating inappropriate content
- **User Support**: No built-in help or support system

## Success Metrics & Status

### Functional Success ✅
- Users can create accounts and manage projects
- Audio playback with dynamic switching works reliably
- Gallery provides good discovery experience
- Project ownership and permissions work correctly
