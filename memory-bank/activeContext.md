# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Cue Timeline Cross-Project Persistence Fix Complete ✅
**Status**: Completed (29/06/2025, 7:00 PM)  
**Task**: Fix cue timeline showing dots from previous projects when creating new projects

Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of cue points persisting visually on the timeline when switching to new projects that have no cue points.

**Problem**: 
- When creating a new project, the cues container list would be empty (correct)
- However, the visual cue-timeline would still display the colored dots from the previous project
- This created confusion where users saw cue points that didn't actually exist in the new project
- The issue occurred because the timeline wasn't being properly cleared when projects had no cue points

**Root Cause**: 
- In `updateCueTimeline()` function, the logic checked `if (currentProject.cuePoints)` 
- For new projects, `cuePoints` property was `undefined` or `null` (not an empty array)
- This caused the function to skip the cue point rendering loop entirely
- The visual dots from the previous project remained because they weren't explicitly cleared

**Solution**: Enhanced the cue point validation logic with defensive programming:
- **Explicit Array Validation**: Added `Array.isArray(currentProject.cuePoints) && currentProject.cuePoints.length > 0` check
- **Guaranteed Timeline Clearing**: Timeline container is always cleared at the start, ensuring clean state
- **Defensive Programming**: Proper null/undefined checks prevent similar issues in the future
- **Clear Documentation**: Added comment explaining the logic for future maintenance

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified `updateCueTimeline()` function to use comprehensive validation
- Changed from `if (currentProject.cuePoints)` to `if (currentProject.cuePoints && Array.isArray(currentProject.cuePoints) && currentProject.cuePoints.length > 0)`
- Ensured `cuePointsContainer.innerHTML = ''` always clears the visual timeline
- Added comment: "If no cue points exist, the container remains empty (already cleared above)"
- Maintained all existing functionality while fixing the edge case

### Cross-Project Progress Bar and Timeline Fix Complete ✅
**Status**: Completed (29/06/2025, 4:03 PM)  
**Task**: Fix progress bar and cue timeline updating when viewing different projects while audio plays from another

Successfully implemented a comprehensive fix to prevent progress bar and cue timeline pollution when navigating between projects with active audio playback.

**Problem**: 
- When audio was playing from Project A and user navigated to Project B, the progress bar and cue timeline in Project B would show progress from Project A's audio
- This created confusing visual feedback where users saw misleading progress information
- Cue timeline showed dynamic progress that didn't match the current project's cue points

**Solution**: Implemented strict project context isolation with the following improvements:
- **Progress Bar Isolation**: Progress bar only updates when viewing the project that's currently playing audio
- **Cue Timeline Separation**: Static cue points always shown for current project, but dynamic progress only shown for playing project
- **Context-Aware Updates**: Enhanced logic to distinguish between static display and dynamic progress updates
- **Cross-Project UI Protection**: Prevents UI pollution when viewing different projects than the one playing audio

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified `updateProgress()` to only update UI when viewing the playing project or in browse view
- Enhanced `updateCueTimeline()` to separate static cue point display from dynamic progress indication
- Added stricter project context validation before updating progress-related UI elements
- Improved `isViewingPlayingProject()` logic for better context awareness
- Ensured timeline shows cue points always but progress only for correct project context

### Mini-Player Cross-Project Navigation Fix Complete ✅
**Status**: Completed (29/06/2025, 3:51 PM)  
**Task**: Fix mini-player behavior when navigating between different projects while audio is playing

Successfully implemented a comprehensive fix for mini-player visibility and audio control conflicts when navigating between different projects.

**Problem**: 
- Mini-player would disappear when navigating to a different project while audio was playing from another project
- Play/Stop buttons on different projects would interfere with each other's audio streams
- Users lost control of audio when viewing projects different from the one playing audio

**Solution**: Implemented smart project context management with the following improvements:
- **Smart Mini-Player Visibility**: Mini-player now stays visible when viewing different projects while audio plays from another
- **Context-Aware Audio Controls**: Play/Stop buttons behave differently based on whether you're viewing the playing project or a different one
- **Project Context Tracking**: Added comprehensive state management for playing vs viewing project contexts
- **Cross-Project Audio Management**: Prevents audio conflicts and provides clear control over which project's audio is active

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified `routeToProject()` to only hide mini-player when returning to currently playing project
- Enhanced `playAudio()` to detect and handle cross-project scenarios
- Updated `stopAudio()` to properly clear playing project context
- Added helper functions: `setPlayingProjectContext()`, `clearPlayingProjectContext()`, `isViewingPlayingProject()`
- Improved `returnToProject()` to use correct project data for navigation

### Cue Points Timeline Display Fix Complete ✅
**Status**: Completed (29/06/2025, 3:22 PM)  
**Task**: Fix cue points not displaying on the cue-timeline for both old and new projects

Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of cue points not displaying on the timeline. The issue was in the `updateCueTimeline()` function which had overly restrictive conditions that prevented cue points from showing in most scenarios.

**Problem**: The function only displayed cue points when both `shouldShowAudioControls()` AND `isViewingPlayingProject()` were true, which meant:
- New projects (no audio playing) never showed cue points
- Old projects (when not currently playing) never showed cue points
- Only projects currently playing audio would show their cue points

**Solution**: Modified the logic to always show cue points when viewing a project detail page, regardless of playback state. The timeline now shows:
- Cue points whenever viewing any project (old or new)
- Progress indicator only when that specific project is playing
- Proper drag-and-drop functionality for project owners
- Correct visual representation of all cue points

### URL Routing Implementation Complete ✅
**Status**: Completed (29/06/2025, 1:10 PM)  
**Task**: Add URL routing and page identification to DM-Player

Successfully implemented comprehensive URL routing system with proper page identification. Each page now has its own URL and the application supports browser back/forward navigation. Added clear page identification comments to make it easier to reference specific pages for future changes.

### Memory Bank Update Complete ✅
**Status**: Completed (29/06/2025, 12:53 PM)  
**Task**: Comprehensive memory bank review and update

The memory bank has been thoroughly reviewed and confirmed to accurately reflect the current state of DM-Player. All documentation is up-to-date and comprehensive, covering the full multi-user system with authentication, project sharing, and advanced audio features.
