1.0.0 : Initial commit.
1.0.1 : Fixed audio stopped playing at first cue point.
1.0.2 : Fixed problem when the first cue point is reached, the playback seems like it's cycling through every track every second. 
1.0.3 : Added two decimal places for cue points values
1.0.4 : Reorganized the UI. 
- Moved the player controls to the top
- Placed tracks and cue points side by side
- modified buttons to add tracks and cue points to + symbols with tool tips
1.0.5 : Cue-point–aware scrubbing has been implemented.
- Dragging the circular handle or clicking the progress bar will now seek the audio; if the seek position passes the next cue point, it triggers an immediate random track switch just as during normal playback. Indicator, handle, and time display remain in sync throughout.
1.0.6 : Added a new cue‐point timeline above the main progress bar, and added dots indicating various cue points.
